### Tactics to pursue strategy

1.  Building Strong Relationships

    Make use of the "Charismatic"
    trait to build strong relationships with other empires through
    diplomacy and trade. This could include offering trade deals,
    sharing resources, and negotiating treaties.
    
    -   Diplomatic Pacts: Negotiate diplomatic pacts, such as
        non-aggression treaties, with other empires. This can help
        establish trust and build relationships that can be leveraged
        in the future.
    -   Trade Agreements: Offer trade agreements to other empires that
        benefit both sides. This can help increase the wealth of both
        empires and improve the relationship between them.
    -   Sharing Resources: Share resources with other empires to
        demonstrate trust and good will. This can be especially
        effective when negotiating trade deals or resolving disputes.
    -   Cultural Exchange: Organize cultural exchange programs with
        other empires to foster greater understanding and
        cooperation. This can include events like exhibitions,
        concerts, and scientific collaborations.
    -   Joint Ventures: Pursue joint ventures with other empires to
        collaborate on projects and share resources. This can help to
        build trust and establish strong relationships over time.
    -   Negotiating Conflicts: Use diplomacy to negotiate conflicts and
        resolve disputes peacefully. This can help to maintain good
        relationships and avoid unnecessary conflict.
    -   Support for Allies: Provide support for allied empires when
        they are in need, whether through resources, military aid, or
        diplomatic support. This can help to strengthen relationships
        and establish a reputation as a reliable ally.

2.  Establishing Trade Networks

    Establishing trade networks with as
    many other empires as possible can help to ensure a steady flow
    of resources and increase wealth. Consider constructing trade
    depots and stations to expand the reach of these networks.
    
    -   Build Trading Posts: Build trading posts on planets and in
        systems with valuable resources. This will allow the Prosperans
        to trade with other empires in these regions and increase the
        reach of their trade networks.
    -   Negotiate Trade Deals: Negotiate trade deals with other empires
        that offer mutually beneficial terms. This can include
        exchanging resources, setting up trade routes, and agreeing on
        trade tariffs.
    -   Expand Reach: Expand the reach of the Prosperan trade network
        by colonizing new planets and establishing new trade
        routes. Look for planets with valuable resources and rich
        environments, and prioritize the development of these colonies
        to maximize trade opportunities.
    -   Enhance Infrastructure: Enhance the infrastructure of trade
        network by investing in transport ships, trade depots, and
        other structures that support trade. This will help to increase
        the efficiency of resource gathering and trade, and make it
        easier to establish new trade routes.
    -   Join Trading Leagues: Join trading leagues and participate in
        trade events to expand the reach of the Prosperan trade network
        and establish new trading partners.
    -   Diversify Products: Diversify the products and resources traded
        by the Prosperans to ensure a steady flow of wealth and avoid
        dependence on a single resource or market.
    -   Monitor Market Trends: Monitor market trends and adjust trade
        strategies as needed to respond to changes in demand and market
        conditions. This can include adjusting trade routes, modifying
        trade agreements, and diversifying products.

3.  Colonizing for Resources

    To counteract the "Wasteful" trait,
    prioritize colonization to secure new resources and
    markets. Look for planets with valuable resources and rich
    environments, and build up colonies to exploit these resources.
    
    -   Prioritize Resource-rich Planets: When selecting planets for
        colonization, prioritize those that are rich in resources, such
        as minerals, energy, or food. These planets will provide the
        resources necessary for growth and expansion, as well as for
        trade with other empires.
    -   Develop Colonies: Once a planet is selected for colonization,
        focus on developing the colony to maximize resource
        extraction. This can include building resource-gathering
        structures, developing transportation networks, and optimizing
        resource-gathering technologies.
    -   Monitor Resource Availability: Monitor the availability of
        resources on each colony and adjust production and
        resource-gathering strategies as needed to ensure that
        resources are being used efficiently.
    -   Expand Resource-Gathering Capabilities: Expand the
        resource-gathering capabilities of the Prosperans by
        researching new technologies, building new structures, and
        developing new resource-gathering techniques. This will help to
        increase the efficiency of resource extraction and allow the
        Prosperans to extract more resources from each colony.
    -   Trade for Resources: Trade for resources with other empires to
        complement the resources available on the Prosperans' own
        colonies. This can help to ensure a steady supply of resources,
        even if one particular resource becomes scarce.
    -   Diversify Resources: Diversify the resources gathered by the
        Prosperans to reduce dependence on a single resource and
        minimize the impact of resource depletion. This can include
        developing new colonies with different resource profiles and
        diversifying trade partners.

4.  Developing the Economy:

    Focus on developing the economy and
    improving resource production and trade. This could include
    investing in infrastructure, improving the efficiency of
    resource gathering and processing, and maximizing the profits
    from trade.
    
    -   Prioritize Infrastructure: Invest in infrastructure
        development, including transport networks, trade depots, and
        resource-gathering structures, to increase the efficiency of
        resource gathering and trade.
    -   Increase Resource Production: Increase resource production by
        developing colonies, researching new technologies, and building
        new structures. This will help to increase the wealth of the
        Prosperan economy and support future growth.
    -   Diversify the Economy: Diversify the economy by investing in
        new industries, such as manufacturing and research, to reduce
        dependence on a single sector and reduce the impact of economic
        downturns.
    -   Encourage Free Trade: Encourage free trade by negotiating
        favorable trade deals with other empires and by participating
        in trade events. This will help to increase the reach of the
        Prosperan trade network and increase the wealth of the economy.
    -   Manage the Budget: Manage the budget carefully to ensure that
        resources are being used efficiently and to avoid
        over-extension. This can include adjusting resource production,
        cutting spending, or increasing taxes as needed.
    -   Invest in Research: Invest in research to develop new
        technologies and improve the efficiency of resource gathering
        and trade. This will help to increase the competitiveness of
        the Prosperan economy and support future growth.
    -   Monitor Market Trends: Monitor market trends and adjust
        economic strategies as needed to respond to changes in demand
        and market conditions. This can include adjusting trade routes,
        modifying trade agreements, and diversifying products.
    
    1.  Monitoring Market Trends:
    
        In Stellaris, market trends can be monitored in the Trade tab of
        the Economic screen. This screen provides information on trade
        routes, trade partners, and the resources being traded. By
        monitoring this information, players can get a better
        understanding of market trends and adjust their economic
        strategies accordingly.
        
        For example, if a particular resource is becoming scarce,
        players can look for alternative trade partners that have a
        surplus of that resource or shift production to other
        resources. If a trade partner is experiencing economic
        difficulties, players can adjust the terms of their trade
        agreement or look for alternative trade partners to minimize the
        impact on their economy.
        
        Additionally, players can monitor market trends by reviewing the
        Market Trends section in the Trade tab. This section provides
        information on the prices of different resources over time and
        allows players to track changes in demand. By monitoring this
        information, players can identify trends and adjust their
        economic strategies to respond to changes in market conditions.
        
        In summary, monitoring market trends in Stellaris involves
        regularly reviewing the Trade tab in the Economic screen and the
        Market Trends section in the Trade tab to get a better
        understanding of the state of the in-game market and to adjust
        economic strategies as needed.

5.  Staying Out of Conflicts:

    As Pacifists, avoid military conflicts
    whenever possible. Consider using diplomacy to resolve disputes,
    or retreating if necessary to avoid unnecessary losses. If war
    is unavoidable, prioritize defense and try to end the conflict
    quickly with minimal casualties.
    
    -   Build Strong Diplomatic Relationships: Build strong diplomatic
        relationships with other empires by negotiating favorable trade
        deals and participating in diplomacy events. This will help to
        ensure that other empires view the Prosperans as valuable
        partners and less likely to engage in conflict.
    -   Avoid Provoking Conflicts: Avoid actions that are likely to
        provoke conflict, such as violating borders, attacking ships,
        or claiming territory. It's important to be mindful of the
        impact of actions and to avoid actions that could trigger
        conflict.
    -   Develop a Strong Economy: Develop a strong economy that
        provides the resources necessary to support a large military
        and maintain good relations with other empires. A strong
        economy can also act as a deterrent to potential aggressors, as
        they may be less likely to engage in conflict with a prosperous
        and economically self-sufficient empire.
    -   Focus on Scientific and Technological Advancements: Focus on
        scientific and technological advancements that improve the
        prosperity and competitiveness of the Prosperan empire. This
        will help to create a more peaceful and stable environment for
        the Prosperans and reduce the likelihood of conflict.
    -   Maintain a Strong Fleet: Maintain a strong fleet to defend
        against potential aggressors, but avoid using it to engage in
        offensive operations. The presence of a strong fleet can act as
        a deterrent to potential aggressors and help to keep the
        Prosperans out of conflicts.
    -   Participate in Galactic Politics: Participate in galactic
        politics by building alliances, forming federations, and
        participating in diplomacy events. This will help to increase
        the political influence of the Prosperans and reduce the
        likelihood of conflict by creating a more stable and peaceful
        political environment.
    -   Respond Diplomatically to Threats: Respond diplomatically to
        potential threats and resolve conflicts peacefully whenever
        possible. This can involve negotiating with other empires,
        offering compensation, or seeking the assistance of allies.
    
    1.  Dealing with "Impossible" races
    
        -   Monitor Their Behavior: Regularly monitor the behavior of
            impossible races to ensure that they are not posing a threat
            to the Prosperans. Keep track of their fleet movements,
            territory acquisitions, and any other signs of aggressive
            behavior.
        -   Build Strong Relationships with Other Empires: Build strong
            relationships with other empires, especially those that are
            likely to be threatened by impossible races. Forming alliances
            and federations can help to create a united front against
            impossible races and reduce the likelihood of conflict.
        -   Focus on Science and Technology: Focus on scientific and
            technological advancements that improve the Prosperans'
            ability to defend themselves against impossible races. Develop
            technologies that enhance the Prosperans' military
            capabilities and provide an edge in defensive operations.
        -   Maintain a Strong Fleet: Maintain a strong fleet to defend
            against potential attacks from impossible races. Keep the
            fleet updated with the latest technologies and regularly train
            the fleet to ensure that it is ready for action when needed.
        -   Avoid Provoking Conflicts: Avoid actions that could provoke
            conflicts with impossible races, such as violating their
            borders, attacking their ships, or claiming territory. These
            actions could trigger a military response from impossible
            races and increase the likelihood of conflict.
        -   Respond Diplomatically to Threats: Respond diplomatically to
            potential threats from impossible races and seek to resolve
            conflicts peacefully whenever possible. This can involve
            negotiating with other empires, offering compensation, or
            seeking the assistance of allies.
        -   Be Prepared for Conflict: Be prepared for conflict if
            necessary. If an impossible race becomes aggressive, be
            prepared to defend the Prosperan empire and protect its
            citizens.
